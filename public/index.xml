      <title>Migrate from Jekyll</title>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>

      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>DataFest is a nationally-coordinated undergraduate competition in which teams of up to 5 students work over a weekend to extract insight from a rich and complex data set. Previous years’ data sets have included crime data from the LAPD, dating data from eHarmony, and energy use data from GridPoint. This year’s data set will be revealed at the opening of the event on Friday evening.
At the conclusion of the competition, each team will have 5 minutes and 2 slides to make a presentation to a panel of judges.</description>

      <description>2018 - Indeed.com Our first year saw 12 undergraduate students from Applied Mathematics, Statistics, but also Computer Science, Construction Management, Civil Engineering, and Biology. The diversity of backgrounds and experiences was amazing. Many students were buzzing afterwards about how much fun they had and how much they learned that weekend.
After two days of intense data wrangling, analysis, presentation design, interspersed with a lot of good free food and caffeine, each team presented their findings to a panel of judges consisting of both on and off campus professionals.</description>
