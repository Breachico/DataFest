      <description>The American Statistical Association&amp;rsquo;s DataFest, founded at UCLA in 2011, is a 48-hour data analysis competition in which undergraduate students from various majors get to work in teams on large, complex, and real-world data. The data is kept secret until opening of the event on Friday evening and teams present their findings to a panel of judges on Sunday afternoon. Students explore, analyze, and visualize the data to discover insights.</description>

You might find it helpful to have a mix of PCs and Macs, since they have different strengths.&#xA;We recommend that you make sure beforehand that the software you will be using throughout the weekend is properly installed and running on your computer. You will be working with a large dataset so make sure that you have the space for it on your hard drive.</description>

      <description>2023 - TBD 2022 - Elm City Stories The 2022 DataFest challenge came from the Play2Prevent lab at the Yale Center for Health &amp;amp; Learning Games in the Yale School of Medicine. DataFest participants analyzed data from Elm City Stories, an educational video game designed for middle and high school students. The goal of the game was to prevent negative health outcomes in young, at-risk adolescents by helping teens to increase perception of risk and to develop skills for predicting and understanding future consequences of actions.</description>

      <description>Financial Contributions Participants are only allowed to work on this project while on site, so our biggest need is making sure they are well fed and caffeinated! Our fundraising goal for 2024 is $4000 which will be spent entirely on food, t-shirts, collaboration supplies such as notepads, whiteboard markers, portable whiteboards, student travel support and prizes for the winners.&#xA;All monetary donations are tax-deductible. Any remaining funds go directly towards supporting student centered Data Science education events such as the outreach and training sessions found on the Chico State DSI website.</description>
