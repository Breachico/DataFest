      <description>2023 - TBD 2022 - Elm City Stories The 2022 DataFest challenge came from the Play2Prevent lab at the Yale Center for Health &amp;amp; Learning Games in the Yale School of Medicine. DataFest participants analyzed data from Elm City Stories, an educational video game designed for middle and high school students. The goal of the game was to prevent negative health outcomes in young, at-risk adolescents by helping teens to increase perception of risk and to develop skills for predicting and understanding future consequences of actions.</description>

      <description>Financial Contributions Participants are only allowed to work on this project while on site, so our biggest need is making sure they are well fed and caffeinated! Our fundraising goal for 2024 is $4000 which will be spent entirely on food, t-shirts, collaboration supplies such as notepads, whiteboard markers, portable whiteboards, student travel support and prizes for the winners.&#xA;All monetary donations are tax-deductible. Any remaining funds go directly towards supporting student centered Data Science education events such as the outreach and training sessions found on the Chico State DSI website.</description>
