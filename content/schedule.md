## Team Forming Event and Sneak peek at the Data! 
### March 25th, 4-5pm Butte 109

Still looking for group? Join us for tacos, to get to know each other, and form teams.

Have a team? You'll still want to join so you can get some very important information about the data. This year is special and you'll get some information this Friday that'll let you get aquainted with the data generating mechanism before the event weekend. 

This meeting will be held via zoom and in person on both campuses, and will be recorded. 

> Be sure to RSVP if you are going to attend in person so we can ensure sufficient tacos.
