<h3>Participate as a Consultant</h3>
<p>Money is helpful but so is your time! Spend an hour or two getting to know the students and offering your sage advice. This is an excellent recruiting opportunity; you get to watch students working in teams, under pressure, striving to understand possibly the most complex data set they have encountered. At other institutions, students have received internships and interviews that have led to full-time employment. Success at DataFest requires that a team have a combination of computational, statistical, and human skills, as well as the ability to communicate clearly and extremely concisely.</p>

<div id="student-safety-teams" class="section level3">
<h3>Student safety teams</h3>
<p>DataFest is open to non-Chico State students, which is a great opportunity for those in the North State region. However Chico State campus policy states that doors must close at midnight. We value the safety of our students and participants and so we are recruiting a group of volunteers who are willing to help provide transportation or escort services for students returning to home or to their cars after midnight.</p>
<p>Email us if you would like to be part of this safety coalition.</p>
