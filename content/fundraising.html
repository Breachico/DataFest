<div id="swag-giveaways-prizes" class="section level3">
<h3>Swag, giveaways, Prizes!!!</h3>
<p>Pens, note pads, USB drives, buttons… Students love these and they help make the event fun. If we get something special, we can give it away in a ``midnight raffle&quot; to help keep the energy level high.</p>

<div id="donate-a-meal" class="section level3">
<h3>Donate a Meal</h3>
<p>Students can only work on this data while on site, so feeding them is critical! If you can’t donate dollars directly, consider sponsoring a meal or snacks for a day.</p>

<div id="participate-as-a-consultant" class="section level3">
<h3>Participate as a Consultant</h3>
<p>Spend an hour or two getting to know the students and offering your sage advice. This is an excellent recruiting opportunity; you get to watch students working in teams, under pressure, striving to understand possibly the most complex data set they have encountered. At other institutions, students have received internships and interviews that have led to full-time employment. Success at DataFest requires that a team have a combination of computational, statistical, and human skills, as well as the ability to communicate clearly and extremely concisely.</p>
