</div>
<div id="social-media" class="section level1">
<h1>Social Media</h1>
<p>Did you know that, this year, DataFest will be held at over 30 universities around the world?
DataFest takes place during a six-week window in the Spring, and different universities hold
their event at different times.</p>
<p>An essential ingredient of Datafest is that the data be a surprise. There are several reasons for
this. One is that it ensures that all teams start on an equal footing. Another is that, even if you
research the organization that donated the data, you might still be totally unprepared for the
context of the data (and maybe less prepared than had you known nothing!) Finally, it is simply
more fun.</p>
<p>You are encouraged to share your excitement on social media and thank our sponsors.
The official Twitter hashtag is #datafest19. However…</p>
<p>PLEASE KEEP THE SECRET UNTIL MAY 4, 7pm. Teams that leak the name or any information
about the identify of the data donor will be disqualified!</p>
<p>Please do not post pictures that reveal any charts/graphs/tables/summaries/models that might
reveal the data donor.</p>
</div>
<div id="computing-and-supplies" class="section level1">
<h1>Computing and supplies</h1>
<p>We recommend that every member of the team bring a laptop, if possible. You might find it helpful to have a mix of PCs and Macs, since they have different strengths.</p>
<p>We recommend that you make sure beforehand that the software you will be using throughout the weekend is properly installed and running on your computer. You will be working with a large dataset so make sure that you have the space for it on your hard drive.</p>
<p>You might want to bring some favorite statistical or computational reference books, if you have them, or bookmark some pages that you routinely refer to.</p>
<p>We will provide meals, snacks, and munchies. Feel free to bring anything additional you might want.</p>
<div id="cloud-computing-resources-for-datafest" class="section level3">
<h3>Cloud computing resources for DataFest</h3>
<p>RStudio is hosted on the cloud at <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/" class="uri">https://rstudio.cloud/</a></p>
<p>You can use a Python instance from Google Colab <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/" class="uri">https://colab.research.google.com/</a></p>
<p>Both of these options are accessible to anyone with a gmail account.</p>
</div>
<div id="data" class="section level2">
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>At the end of the kickoff presentation each team should send one member to the registration desk at Selvester’s Cafe and check out a USB stick containing the data. When you’re done downloading the data off it please return it to the registration desk so that another team can use it.</p>
<div id="large-data-advice" class="section level3">
<h3>Large data advice</h3>
<p>The dataset you will be working with is quite large. If you type a variable name to view it, it will take a while to display. Therefore, remember these R commands: <code>head()</code>, <code>tail()</code>, <code>str()</code>.</p>
<p>We strongly recommend you create a small data set that you can use to test things on. Then, if it works out, you can apply your procedure to the large dataset. Some procedures can take a frustratingly long time to run on large data sets, and so it will be comforting to know that your procedure works (because you tested it on a smaller data set) while you wait. We recommend taking a random sample of rows from the original data set, but there might be other approaches you find useful.</p>

<div id="presentations-judging-and-awards" class="section level1">
<h1>Presentations, judging, and awards</h1>
<div id="presentations" class="section level2">
<h2>Presentations</h2>
<p>Each team will have 4 minutes + 1 minute Q&amp;A to present their findings to the judges. That’s exactly 4 minutes, not 4 minutes and a few additional seconds. Each team will be allowed at most two slides. Two! So at some point Saturday night or Sunday morning, you might want to set aside time to think about what you want the judges to know. The 4 minute presentation and 1 minute Q&amp;A time limits will be strictly enforced. All team members must be present for the presentation, but not all team members need to actually speak (given the time limitation).</p>
<p><strong>Optional</strong></p>
<p>Along with your presentation you are also allowed to turn in a one-page write-up of your project. You can think about this as the text of your presentation. The judges can refer to these during deliberation. You will upload these documents along with your presentation. Only 1 page will be printed.</p>
<div id="submitting-your-presentation" class="section level4">
<h4>Submitting your presentation</h4>
<p>At 1pm on Sunday all work must stop and you must upload your presentation and your optional write up to the submission website linked at the top of this page (available starting Sunday AM). If you are having technical difficulty, you can ask a consultant for help. Consultants will be around to help.</p>
<p>Teams who fail to upload their presentations and write-ups by 1:0pm on Sunday will not be eligible to have their presentations judged.</p>
</div>
<div id="file-naming" class="section level4">
<h4>File naming</h4>
<p>The files you’re submitting must be named in the following manner:</p>
<ul>
<li>[Team Name] - Presentation</li>
<li>[Team Name] - Writeup</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="allowed-file-formats" class="section level4">
<h4>Allowed file formats</h4>
<ul>
<li>We very strongly recommend using PDF, Keynote, or PowerPoint.</li>
<li>If using a web-based tool like GoogleDocs or Prezi, please export to PDF and upload the PDF as your submission.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that you will not have time to log on/off to your account before your presentation. We don’t want to restrict your creativity but it is your responsibility to make sure that your presentation works seamlessly before the judging session begins.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="judging" class="section level2">
<h2>Judging</h2>
<p>The Judges will convene in a side room to deliberate and rank their nominations.
Three of these will be selected for the award categories listed below.
The judges also have the option to name a fourth winner as Judges’ Pick.</p>
<p>All are welcomed to the presentations and award ceremony.</p>
</div>
<div id="awards" class="section level2">
<h2>Awards</h2>
<p>Awards will be given in three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Best Insight</li>
<li>Best Use of Outside Data</li>
<li>Best Visualization</li>
</ul>
<p>These are listed in no particular order.</p>
<p>The judges also have the option to name a fourth winner as Judges’ Pick.</p>
<p>Award ceremony will take place in Selvester’s Cafe.</p>
<p>Winners will receive medals and books as well as one-year student memberships to the American Statistical Association. See <a href="http://www.amstat.org/membership/" class="uri">http://www.amstat.org/membership/</a> for membership benefits.</p>
<div id="raffle-prizes" class="section level4">
<h4>Raffle prizes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Throughout the event we will be giving out raffle prizes. Announcements for these will be shared on social media or through Slack. Follow these channels to get a chance to win one of these sweet prizes!</li>
<li>Winning will also require that you are on premises at the time a prize is announced.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="recruiting" class="section level2">
<h2>Recruiting</h2>
<p>DataFest is a great recruiting opportunity for many employers, and surely they won’t miss it!</p>
<p>Many of our sponsors are attending the event so you can find out more about them.</p>
<p>Most of our consultants are coming from companies who are recruiting or at a minimum wanting to meet you, so chat with them, find out what they do, network.</p>
<p>We will collect resumes and share them with some of our sponsors. Participation in the resume book is optional, but highly recommended. You will receive information about this during the event.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="rules" class="section level1">
<h1>Rules</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>You can come and go as you please, but all work must be completed on premises.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not use any space other than Sylvesters, or work after midnight. Students found working in other areas or after midnight will be disqualified from the competition.</p></li>
<li><p>You must follow the Code of Conduct. This can be found at <a href="https://chicodatafest.netlify.com/faq/" class="uri">https://chicodatafest.netlify.com/faq/</a> and printed at the event.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not share the name of the data source publicly or on social media before May 4th. There are many other upcoming DataFests around the country and we want to make sure the dataset remains a surprise for them.</p></li>
<li><p>Before your team gets the data all members must have signed Non-Disclosure agreement on file at the registration desk. You can freely share your results, presentations, findings, etc. as part of your digital portfolio, however you are not allowed to share the raw data with anyone outside of DataFest. At the end of DataFest, you must delete all data from thumb drives, hard drives, etc. The data are sensitive.</p></li>
<li><p>As much as possible during the event there will be a friendly consultants present. These are faculty, grad students, or other professionals from our community. Not all will have field specific knowledge on the dataset. They all have different areas of expertise, so if you get stuck on something and one consultant isn’t able to help, ask someone else later. Feel free to ask anything. This is not an exam, but a collaboratory competition. Do not expect the consultants to write code for you, or do data management, etc. They are there to help point you in the right direction, but you’re responsible for getting there on your own.</p></li>
<li><p>PLEASE KEEP THE SECRET UNTIL MAY 4, 7pm. Teams that leak the name or any information about the identify of the data donor will be disqualified! Please do not post pictures that reveal any charts/graphs/tables/summaries/models that might reveal the data donor.</p></li>
<li><p>Please do not tweet, hashtag, Facebook, snapchat, etc about the identify of the donor or the context of the data. This means you should refrain from any hints, explicit or implicit statements that might reveal the context of the data.</p></li>
<li><p>Be careful about github repositories. Make sure yours is invisible to the outside world.</p></li>
</ul>
